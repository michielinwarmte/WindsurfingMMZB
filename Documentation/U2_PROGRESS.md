# U2 progress (handoff)

The live state of U2, "the fin bends, and its size". The plan and its execution brief are in [PLAYTEST_UPGRADES.md](PLAYTEST_UPGRADES.md). **The lead updates and commits this file after every launch, report and merge.** A lead who takes over starts here; U1's take-over prompt in [U1_PROGRESS.md](U1_PROGRESS.md) applies with U2 in place of U1.

- **Branch:** `feature/u2-fin` (from `feature/u1-planing-wet-area` at c1eee63). Agents work on `u2/<name>` branches, made from it in their own worktrees.
- **Last update:** 19 October 2026. Agent 1 merged; the brief's chord law and flex-test default corrected. Agent 2 still running.

## State

| # | Agent | Package | State | Branch | Report |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `fin_sources` | the stiffness, the catalogue fins, the literature | merged | `u2/fin_sources` | [fin_sources.md](u2_reports/fin_sources.md) |
| 2 | `fin_measure` | the fin's baseline, the overrides, the telemetry, the what-ifs, the pending check | running | `u2/fin_measure` | |
| 3 | `fin_physics` | the bending fin, by the lead's design | waits for Stop 1 | `u2/fin_physics` | |
| 4 | `fin_look` | the bending mesh, the HUD, the screenshots, the checklist | waits for Stop 2 | `u2/fin_look` | |

| Stop | State |
|---|---|
| Stop 1, the lead: agents 1 and 2 in, the stiffness sourced | not reached |
| Stop 2, the lead reviews agent 3's diff, then Michiel | not reached |
| Stop 3, Max's play-test | not reached |

## Next action

Agents 1 and 2 are running. For each that reports: read `Documentation/u2_reports/<name>.md` on `u2/<name>`, merge into `feature/u2-fin`, verify, set its state here, commit. When both are in: Stop 1 (the stiffness sourced, nothing regressed); the lead fills the flex-test numbers into the design and launches agent 3 with the two reports. An agent that was running but has no committed report is relaunched with the brief's prompt.

## Numbers

**Baseline (the lead, 19 October 2026, the 18 kt beam reach of U1's Latest):** fin lift 527 N at a 2.0 deg slip (stall at 12 deg), drag 35 N, roll moment from the fin 111 N m, heel -4.5 deg, rig lean 25 deg, so the heel's upward part of the fin's force is about 41 N. Agent 2 measures the 9 cases.

## Open items

- Max's own fins: brand, model, and if possible a flex test (clamp the base, hang a known weight at the tip, measure the tip's displacement).
- Inherited from U1: the red onset check, the pending wet-area targets, the hands' share, the rail-down angle, `board.glb`.

## Notes

Decisions and surprises along the way, newest first.

- 19 October 2026 (agent 1): the stiffness has a measured source: a 37 cm F-Hot carbon slalom fin, 100 N at 80 % of the span moves the load point 20 mm (Nascimento 2017, IST Lisbon); its FEA bends the tip 0.106 mm per newton of sailing lift, the brief's beam 0.112 mm, within 6 %. No G10 test found (G10 probably 2 to 4 times stiffer, estimate). Unifiber G10 freeride: 38 cm 365 cm², 44 cm 411 cm². Makers say a soft tip lifts the board and shrinks the wet area; no number anywhere for the upward force. Spin-out at 8 to 16° in three measurements. Twist findings contradict each other: left out, as planned. Preview with the beam: 70 N up from the bend at 527 N on the 38 cm fin, 161 N at 800 N; the 44 cm fin 105 and 238 N (tip angle 32° at 800 N, near the 35° cap). **The lead corrected the chord law:** `c_root = area / (0.686 × span)` keeps the area right for every span.

- 19 October 2026 (the lead): the fin's upward push has two parts, the board's heel (in the model, 41 N today) and the fin's bend (not in the model). A fin bent toward its force tilts that force upward on both tacks. The bend is a cantilever with the stiffness falling as the chord to the fourth power, so the tip does the bending; one flex test sets the scale. Details in the brief.
